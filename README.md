# Shakespeare-text-analysis

This project analyzes text data from 36 Shakespeare plays. 
It also uses metadata about the plays' genres and incorporates a database of names and their corresponding genders. 
Together, these three data sets allow the user to mine the text of Shakespeare's plays for insights into:
(1) how textual features distinguish plays of different genres, and 
(2) how textual features distinguish men's speech from women's speech in these plays.

Obtaining the data: 

Text data: http://shakespeare.mit.edu/

Gender and name data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gender+by+Name#
